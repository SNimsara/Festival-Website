		      <p class="card-text">A holy festival is a noteworthy event that has deep religious or spiritual significance for a certain group or faith. These celebrations frequently memorialize notable occasions, honor religious leaders, or signal significant dates in the religious calendar. They frequently involve large crowds of people and are distinguished by rituals, rites, and prayers.<br><br>

			People may partake in a variety of religious activities during holy festivals, including going to church, praying, marching in processions, fasting, paying alms, and doing good deeds. The events frequently also include festive accents, music, dances, and special meals.<br><br>
				  
			Holy festivals provide an opportunity for people to join together, grow in religion, show appreciation, ask for blessings, and feel a sense of community. They offer a chance for introspection, refreshment, and strengthening spiritual ties. These celebrations are essential for passing down religious and cultural customs from one generation to the next.<br><br>

			In general, holy festivals promote a sense of harmony and awe among people who have a same religious or cultural heritage. They are times of joy, devotion, and spiritual significance.</p>

		      <h5 class="card-title">Dia de los muertos - Mexico</h5>
		      <p class="card-text">Families gather to pray for and mourn deceased relatives during the Mexican holiday known as "Day of the Dead," which occurs between October 31 and November 2. Both public and private ofrendas (altars) are built, and they are frequently lavishly decorated with pumpkins and squash, marigolds, candles, and sugar skulls. Ofrendas are meant to 'welcome home' the souls of departed loved ones; they are more of a doorway than a place of worship. A few cities also hold costumed parades, most notably Oaxaca.<br><br>

			Families congregate at gravesides at dusk, but the mood is anything but morbid: there is eating, storytelling, singing, and occasionally even a roving mariachi band.</p>

		      <h5 class="card-title">Obon Festival, Japan</h5>
		      <p class="card-text">Japanese people have been remembering their ancestors for more than 500 years at the three-day holiday known as Obon, which is typically held in August. Folk dances called Bon Odori, seasonal fare, and bonfires are used to commemorate it. Huge bonfires organized in the shape of kanji, or Japanese characters, are some of the biggest fires, and they can be found in the hills surrounding Kyoto.<br><br>

			In Japan, this is a time when families get together to visit graves and present food at temples and shrines. After the event, people congregate along lakes and rivers to float paper lanterns that serve as a waypoint for departed family members to return to the spirit realm.</p>

		      <p class="card-text">Every year in January or February, Québec City celebrates the chilly weather as locals and guests flock to its brightly lit streets for a hearty winter carnival. The carnival, which lasts two weeks, includes two nighttime parades led by its jovial mascot, Bonhomme ('good-natured guy'), whose enormous ice palace is built and carved especially each year and serves as the festival's center point.<br><br>

			You may also enjoy ice skating, see teams compete in ice canoe races along the St. Lawrence River, and view further exquisite sculptures expertly fashioned out of ice blocks. Furthermore, there is a ton of live entertainment, street food, and heated terraces where you can relax with a hot chocolate while taking in the ambiance.</p>

		      <h5 class="card-title">Dragon Boat Festival -Chaina</h5>
		      <p class="card-text">The Dragon Boat Festival, also known as Duanwu Festival, is a traditional Chinese festival celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, which usually falls in May or June. Here's a simple description of the Dragon Boat Festival:<br>

			The Dragon Boat Festival is named after the popular activity of dragon boat racing, which is the highlight of the festival. Dragon boats are long, narrow boats decorated like dragons, with a team of rowers paddling to the beat of a drum.<br><br>

			The festival has its roots in ancient Chinese folklore and is primarily associated with commemorating the poet and statesman Qu Yuan. Qu Yuan lived during the Warring States period in ancient China and was known for his loyalty to his kingdom. When his kingdom fell, he drowned himself in the river out of despair. The Dragon Boat Festival is said to have originated from the efforts of the local people who raced their boats to search for Qu Yuan's body and to prevent fish and evil spirits from devouring it.<br><br>

			In addition to the dragon boat races, the festival is also known for several other customs and traditions. One of the most well-known customs is the consumption of zongzi, which are sticky rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves and filled with various fillings like meat, beans, or nuts. Zongzi are traditionally eaten during the festival to ward off evil spirits and to pay tribute to Qu Yuan.<br><br></p>
